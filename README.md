#notes
1- i tried to not use any third party liberary or styling framework to show my abilities using the native technology stack (with only mui for the error message)
2- i tried to come up with the design myself by taking inspiration from multiple online templates so execuse my designing skills if it wasn't that great
3- i tried to make the components and the functions as dynamic and as reusable as possible so it can work even if the file was on the server side by only changing the fetch url
4- i could have made the website full of animations but i didnt have any ideas on where should i use animations so i kept it as simple
