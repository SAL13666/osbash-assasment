# Osbash Technical Assessment

## Installation
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. React
4. Redux and Redux Toolkit
5. Material-UI

## Notes
- I tried to not use any third-party libraries or styling frameworks to showcase my abilities using the native technology stack. (With only Material-UI for the error message.)
- I tried to come up with the design myself by taking inspiration from multiple online templates, so excuse my designing skills if it wasn't that great.
- I tried to make the components and the functions as dynamic and as reusable as possible so it can work even if the file was on the server side by only changing the fetch URL.
- I could have made the website full of animations, but I didn't have any ideas on where should I use animations so I kept it as simple.
